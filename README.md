# Burger Builder App Notes:

    - Planning Phase
        - Component Tree/Component Structure
        - Application State (Data)
        - Components vs. Containers
    - npm run eject
        - Enableds CSS modules
        - Makes sure that the CSS classes created in a CSS file  can be scoped to a specific component, so they are not applied globally when we reuse the CSS class.
    - Items in the Containers folder are stateful components (i.e. components created with the class keyword, or functional components using useState.
    - Items in the Components folder are dumb/stateless components, and are used simply as presentational components.
    - The Layout functional component is used to wrap content.
    - All custom components should be imported with a capital first letter.
    - Conventional to use PropTypes on class based components.
    - Shorter syntax/code is more modern code.
        - State vs. Constructor
    - State should be updated in an immutable fashion.
